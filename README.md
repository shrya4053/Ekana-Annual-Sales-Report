## Project Insight
- Sales peaked during March–May, showing strong seasonal demand. After July, there was a gradual decline, indicating reduced post-summer activity.
- Women account for 64% of total sales, showing they are the dominant customer base. Men represent 36%, suggesting targeted marketing could help boost engagement among male buyers.
- 92% of orders were successfully delivered — indicating high fulfillment efficiency. Only a small portion (8%) faced cancellations, returns, or refunds, suggesting strong product satisfaction.
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh lead in total sales. These three states together contribute over half of total revenue, showing strong regional performance.
- Adult women form the largest sales group (55%), followed by men in the same category (24%). Teen and senior customer segments remain minimal — indicating untapped potential for targeted campaigns.
- Amazon (35%) drives the highest sales, followed by Flipkart (22%) and Myntra (23%). Expanding on Myntra and Flipkart can diversify dependency on Amazon.											

## Conclusion
- The company shows strong delivery performance and female-dominated buying trends.
